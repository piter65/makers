The Three Box AI system

High concept:
 Break down server into three ai components (boxes).
 Each component has a specific purpose.


Rules (for now):  
 Always keep raw input for reference.
 All (almost all) logic for lower case (until otherwise)



Box 1:  Pre-processing.
 This is box is mostly responsible for filtering the initial text,
 mostly a series of string replacements to simplify possible outcomes.
 Long term this box will be used for things like counting stall phrases, "em",
  counting power words, other scoring outside of NLP stuff.

 Think in terms of the 3-5 types of replacements.
  Type 1: Drop articles and nonsense phrases
   "_a_" replace with "_"
   "_the_" replace with "_"

  Type 2: Synonyms
   "canine" -> "dog"
   "feline" -> "cat"
   
  Type 3: Idioms -- Might want to be done before others-
   "let_the_cat_out_of_the_bag" ->"reveal"

  Type 4: intentions - This is a stop-gap to fake Box 2, peter believes with ENOUGH phrasing, (1000s),
    we could fake 90% of it.  Takes a processed string and generates an intent and 
  "Sounds goood to me" -> agreement
  "I want anchoves" -> desire anchovies

-- If we stick with this, we may have huge #'s of these, and need to consider 
-- high tech (low tech) options, such as hash tables, etc.

 For starters, we should probably just do this in JS, with JSON translation files.

Box 2: 
 RASA - convert text string into intents, entities, etc.


Box 3:
 Logic:  Given intent and entities, 
    what reply to we play,
    Do we advance to next act,
     What scoring do we keep.
 
Im guessing we write specific javascript code with dozens of if statments?
