Peter's initial ideas on what would be good to keep:

session #:  (probably a unique # based on time I think)
userid :    (so we can reference back)
start date/time:
end date/time:
(total time?):  (I'm really interested in this stat at the moment)
server/game version:
game id:  (pizza, real game, etc)
system (ios/android/text):

overall score:
subscores:
  empathy
  understanding
  exec
  (something else)
  other stuff (TBD)
 # of words
 # of stall words.
 # of pg words.
 # of r words.
 # of x words.
 # of 3 syllable words
 # of 4 syllable words
